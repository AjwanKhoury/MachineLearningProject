Customer Segmentation Project
We are an online company and we have dataset containing online sales.
We want to segment our customers to groups to give them targeted commercials.
My Goal in this project is to find the best customer segmentation.

### METHODS

**in this project i will use differents method listed below with an explanation**

- `EDA`: since we want to learn about the customer in order to get better result it is imperative to understand the data. the eda step will introduce us to the data and the behaviour (distribution and more) but also since we having dateType feature i will also use some timeseries method to get some information about the purchases abbit time wise
- `PREPROCESSING` : after understanding the data some of the feature will need some preparation like droping,cleaning,transformation,and of course outliers
- `FEATURE ENGINEERING` is a key step that might lead to good result (new feature based on the data so we can use the new df instead of the source
- `MODELING`: after all th steps mentined above i will implement some algo (diffeent) and check for the algorithm that lead to better overall reesult 
- `CONCLUSION` : the last but most important step will be to conclude our result and why.
